# Fade in animation with a 2x2 grid

This Android Studio project demonstrates how to animate layout changes using a transition. The initial layout is a simple 2x2 grid created with `LinearLayout`s.

Code is Java.

The app uses an Activity that hosts a single Fragment. The animation occurs in the Fragment.
